# MediBook

A simple appointment booking app for small businesses (hair salons, clinics, etc).

## Problem Solved

Helps small businesses manage appointments, staff, and client info without expensive software.

## Tools Used

- **React** (UI)
- **Vite** (build tool)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)
- **TypeScript** (type safety)
- **Mock API** (in `src/api/mockApi.ts`)
- **Local Storage** (data persistence, no backend used)

## Staff Logins

logins for clinic staff (for demo/testing):

| Name         | Username     | Password   |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Dr. Smith    | dr-smith     | smith123   |
| Nurse Jane   | nurse-jane   | jane123    |
| Dr. Alice    | dr-lee       | lee123     |

## How It Works

- All appointment and user data is stored in the browser (local storage).
- The mock API simulates real backend calls.
- Easy to run locally:  
  1. `npm install`  
  2. `npm run dev`  
  3. Open the app in your browser.

Great for demos, prototypes, or small teams needing a lightweight solution.
